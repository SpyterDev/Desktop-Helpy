Helpy is one of my favorite character from FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy's) so I decided to add him as an example. Of course, I don't own the sprites or music but I thought it might be cool (FNAF 6 is my favorite FNaF Game)!

The Sprites:
	Scott Cawthon - Helpy

The Theme:
	Just Add Water - Composed by Leon Riskin, owned by Scott Cawthon
