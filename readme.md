## Desktop Helpy
This is just the Desktop Bro Player (a really small Desktop Pet engine I made) bundled with the Helpy animation and the restraunt theme from FNaF 6!

## Why?
Who doesn't love Helpy?
Me personally Helpy is one of my favorite character from FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy's) and I wanted to have him dance around in the corner of my screen while I'm doing homework!
